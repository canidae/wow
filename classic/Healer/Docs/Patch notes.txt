[b]Healer/Nuker 6.6 -- 2006.07.16[/b]
[ul]
[li]Fixed error triggered by healing bandaged target (line 4115 error).  Not thoroughly tested.
[li]Fixed error in Healer_PrintBuffsNeeded that occured when a printed spell didn't have a rank.
[li]Updated toc to 1.11
[li]Modified remove debuff to remove unselected debuffs out of battle (like it originally did).  In other words, if a debuff is deselected in the GUI, it will not be removed during battle.
[li]Added a check in UpdatePlayerDataWrapper in case time some how wraps around.  [i]Might[/i] help buffing over and over problem.
[li]Fixed German translation of Dampen Magic (thanks Tamaron)
[li]Updated to latest version of the C-addon.
